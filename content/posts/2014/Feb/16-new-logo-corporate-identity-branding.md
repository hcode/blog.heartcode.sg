Today we celebrate HeartCode's very first birthday. 365 days ago, the founding team registered HeartCode Pte. Ltd. and set on a mission to improve lives and the society through the use of information technology.

Over the past year, our corporate identity consisting of the "code" logo, red and white theme, and the binary heart icon served us well.

As we evolved and progressed over the year, our identity has mostly stayed the same, picking up flourishes and building definition along the way while we keep our mission and core processes. Parallel to our accomplishments, we felt that our identity needs to be upgraded, to best represent us in our philosophy.

The first thing you would notice is our new logo. In our new logo, we feature the very same heart and "C" from the previous logo, that takes the form of a ring. The upright "C" stands for code and it represents the software technology work that we do, supporting and following where the Heart goes. The new colour scheme of Red, Grey and White represents well the 3 corporate values of Passion, Professionalism and Synergy. 

The fonts Source Sans Pro and Georgia are also carefully chosen to be our corporate fonts. The Source Sans Pro font has a name that coincidentally goes with "source code".

Our believe and hope in the company is best represented in our new logo and we hope it will bring us to greater heights: building our company culture and serving as a clear and unique corporate identity.
