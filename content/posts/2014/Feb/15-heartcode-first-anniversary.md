Tomorrow marks HeartCode's first birthday. Since HeartCode's founding on 16 Feb 2013, we had achieved quite something: getting more projects that are in line with what we believe as well as upgraded from study benches of Ngee Ann Polytechnic and Republic Polytechnic into a furnished and cosy office at Woodlands 11.

Earlier today, my team and I came together in a closed event, celebrating our close friends who stood by and believed in us. We are thankful for our families and friends, who knitted close to HeartCode through this one year of progress and challenges and became the greatest source of support

In particular for the First Anniversary celebration, I would like to thank two friends: Michelle Teo and Joyce Ho who baked and sponsored cupcakes and cookies to fill all of our tummies. I would also like to thank all friends who came down to warm up the office.

Also, we would like to thank YouPrintIt Pte Ltd for the printing services provided in printing of our lovely postcards and company banner.
