"Why didn't you move into Ayer Rajah Crescent? Isn't that where all the tech startups are?" Those were the very questions our computer science / engineering / startup friends ask when [HeartCode moved into Woodlands 11](http://blog.heartcode.sg/posts/2014/Jan/1-new-year-new-office). 

The [tech community in Ayer Rajah](http://beyondthevalley.co/2012/06/03/block-71-singapores-hidden-secret/) grew greatly following the opening of one-north MRT station on the circle line and launch of many tech events and initiatives over the past years. With the [recent developments and plans](http://www.techinasia.com/singapores-block-71-double-capacity-2014/) that the Singapore Government has for the startup community, it led me to think that it is important for startups to carefully evaluate where work from and to plant their first office.

###Cafe Startup

Before 1 Jan 2014, members of the HeartCode team worked from either home, study areas in school or a cafe like Starbucks or Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf. That was the norm for us for over a year, and we do it weekly.

> Here's a bonus: at one point of time we were regulars at the Starbucks tucked away behind Bishan MRT Station. The quaint cafe at Bishan Community Centre has a very nice study/work table in the center. During non-peak, Starbucks Bishan is our defacto choice over crowded cafes near MRT stations.

Working at home, study areas or cafe is definitely much cheaper than renting an office. We saved a lot of money on rental and office space. It is also said that working in a cafe boosts [productivity and creativity](http://coffitivity.com/). 

Eventually we decided to rent and [hire to propel](http://heartcode.sg/jobs) our company growth.

###Building a company that provides service

At HeartCode, we provide software development services with value-adding Corporate Social Responsibility programme. Our clients approached HeartCode for requirements-fitting software development often result in greater organisation efficiency and streamlined processes.  

On the other hand, most startups in Blk 71 focuses on one app or software as their product - and often they have their "Chief Technology Officer" and programmers on their founding team to create a minimum viable product. There is little match between what we do vs what the Ayer Rajah community do.

It would be difficult for HeartCode to work out deals with the other startups at Blk 71. 

###An office space for the people in it

> Too many twenty-something founders look for employees just like themselves. “So you discriminate against anyone who is in their 30s or 40s or has a family,” says [Matt Mickiewicz from Hired](http://www.fastcolabs.com/3018568/why-your-startup-cant-find-developers). “But the most talented and experienced people will be in their 30s and 40s."
 
As the founding team consists of all twenty-something, we hope to build a family-friendly company that allows the most talented and experienced people to unleash their potential to the fullest in a cubicle-free software development studio. 

Our office is in a business hub community located conveniently by Admiralty MRT Station. There are 3 childcare centres, several food courts with affordable price around $2.50 to $3.00, Shogun Fight Gym (Silat, Judo, Muay Thai - on level 8) and even a wedding dress boutique on our floor!

The environment must be able to support the lifestyle and work-life balance of the people working there. That to us is more important than having the company at the tech and innovation community. If you feel like you are at home while working, then work will definitely be enjoyable. 

###Spotlight in a diversified community

With over 400 other units in Woodlands 11 that does mainly warehousing, supply chain, hardware and furniture, it becomes easy for our neighbours to remember us as "the software development studio". There is much development potential in this community to us, than in 71 Ajer Rajah Crescent.

###Conclusion

Blk 71 is a great place for innovation and technology development, away from the overcrowded Central Business District area. However, it is not suited for all startups and founders should include options in the heartlands in consideration of a workspace.
