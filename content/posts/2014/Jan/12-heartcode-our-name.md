With the recent opening of our new office at [Woodlands 11](https://goo.gl/maps/g2Kgq), we have curious people asking how we came up with the name "HeartCode" and the meaning behind it. 

[When HeartCode was founded](http://heartcode.sg/about/founding), all of us came together with a great vision set in mind: to improve society using software and technology innovation in the social sector's voluntary welfare organisations (VWO), social welfare organisations (SWO) and non-profit organisations (NPO). 

We decided that there were two words that best describe what we want to achieve: "Heart" and "Code". 
___

###Heart

Staying true to our vision, we use our hearts to feel and understand the different needs of our society. 

Defined by the [Merriam Webster's Online Dictionary](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/heart), the word *Heart* is defined to be "one's innermost character, feelings, or inclinations." We believe that only by putting in our best efforts using our hearts, we will deliver quality software make our society better.

###Code

In creating software applications, our software designers and developers work tirelessly to craft great solutions that fit the needs of our clients.

The process of converting written instructions into user-friendly software by our people is also often referred to coding. This represents the very core work that we provide in our business.

___

By joining the two words, we came up with "HeartCode". Through our company name, we give only the best in coding great software applications and technologies that can only come from our hearts.

By the way, HeartCode is turning big 1 year old this coming February! Stay tuned on [our blog](https://blog.heartcode.sg/), [Facebook](https://facebook.com/heartcodesg) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/heartcodesg) for more updates!
