Today we move into our first new office [located](https://goo.gl/maps/g2Kgq) at a new industrial community, Woodlands 11.

The business hub is located:

- *10-mins walk* from [**Admiralty MRT Station**](https://goo.gl/maps/pn0Xk).
- Bus [**962**](http://www.transitlink.com.sg/eservice/eguide/service_route.php?service=962) connecting *3 MRT stations* (Woodlands, Admiralty and Sembawang) running along our main road
- Bus [**912**](http://www.transitlink.com.sg/eservice/eguide/service_route.php?service=912) running nearby on *Woodlands Ring Road* from Woodlands to Admiralty.
- Drive off Seletar Expressway (SLE) into Woodlands Ave 12 (Exit 9). Turn into *Woodlands Close* after passing the Seagate building.

We are sure to be operational regardless rain or shine, MRT or bus breakdown. 

Our new office address is as follows:

> 11 Woodlands Close, #06-26 Room E, Woodlands 11, Singapore 737853

Here's some sneak peek on the items we've brought into our cosy little office.
