With the recent opening of our new office at [Wooldands 11](https://goo.gl/maps/g2Kgq), questions might has arise to how we named our company, and why we did so.

If you had not alredy known, HeartCode was initially a team which comprised of 6-7 members. Some of the team members were previously involved in a project called TAVI, an application aimed to improved the lives of blind commuters in Singapore. But, all of whom came together with a greater goal in mind; to help society by giving aid to VWO, SWO, non-profit organisations and improving their processes and outreach through innvation. 

Heart 

Why "Heart"? We believe that to be true and sincere in our vision, we must use our heart to feel and understand the different needs of our society. As quoted from Google; Heart - "The central or innermost part of something." Only by using our innermost feelings would we be able to bring out the best in what we do.

Code

And "Code"? I believe this needs no explanation. Our works come in the form of software applications and solutions; requring expertise in different markup language aka coding. 

Thus by joining the two words, we named ourselves "HeartCode".

Through coding, we aim to give the best, and the best could only come from our heart.

With this, HeartCode is turning 2! Stay tune for more updates!
