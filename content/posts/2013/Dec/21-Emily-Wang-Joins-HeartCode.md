Emily is a lover for cute and great designs. Her role at HeartCode is to expand our services to more clients and spot potential opportunities for partnerships.

In her free time, she enjoys watching movie and doing handicrafts. Though a little short sightedness, she doesn't wear spectacles, and will wrongly recognise people walking towards her as acquaintances and say hello to them. 

Emily, welcome to the team!
