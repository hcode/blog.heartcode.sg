For the first time, we had our Christmas dinner together at Bobby's, CHIJMES, last evening.

Everyone in the team, including Michelle and Karina, had the dinner under the stars with great ambience and Santa's hats on them. We had games, gift exchanges and of course great food and drinks. It was kind of a reward for all our hard work through this year.

If you're interested to find out about where we ate, [Bobby's](http://www.bobbys.com.sg/) is located at CHIJMES - a 5-minute walk from City Hall MRT Station.
